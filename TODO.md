TODOs
========================================

* when invalid error, then show file/line number, and maybe even (underlined) snippet
* support adding comments
* extensibility: allow for totally custom yaml entries
* showcase building layer on top of DSL (reuse, reference, ...)

Ideas for further Kaml libraries
-------------

* OpenApi
* Github (workflow action)
* Kustomize (base, overlays, ... all in one file. it will setup dir structure for you)
* Azure DevOps Build
* OpenShift
